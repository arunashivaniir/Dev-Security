# DevSecOps Learning Journey 

A structured, hands-on journey into Secure Web Development and DevSecOps fundamentals.  
This repository contains practical exercises, API projects, security hardening steps, and notes focused on building and defending modern web applications.

## What I'm Learning
- **Web Architecture** — HTTP, DNS, HTTPS, client–server flow  
- **Backend Fundamentals** — Node.js, Express, routing, middleware  
- **Secure API Development** — validation, sanitization, error handling  
- **Security Best Practices**  
  - Helmet (security headers)  
  - Rate Limiting  
  - CORS configuration  
  - Input trimming & sanitization  
  - Request logging  
- **CRUD API Implementation** — without database, focusing on logic & security  
- **Filtering, Sorting & Pagination** for real-world API behavior  
- **Error & Edge-Case Handling** (404, 500, invalid input, etc.)

## Security Layers Implemented
- Security headers (Helmet)  
- DoS protection (Rate Limiter)  
- CORS restrictions  
- Input validation (express-validator)  
- Input sanitization (sanitize-html)  
- Logging of request body + method  
- Centralized error handlers  

## 📁 Project Structure
- `/Dev-Security` — Key learnings & concepts  
- `/Week_1` — Backend code with layered middleware pipeline  

## Goals
- Become a **security-focused backend developer**  
- Build production-grade secure APIs  
- Transition toward **DevSecOps practices**: automation, CI/CD, scanning, secure deployments

This repo evolves as I move deeper into secure backend engineering and DevSecOps.
